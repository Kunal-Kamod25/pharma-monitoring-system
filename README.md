# 🧪 Pharma Industrial Sensor Monitoring & Alert System

A real-time pharma cleanroom monitoring system inspired by industrial data historian platforms like AVEVA PI and SCADA systems.  
This project simulates industrial sensor data (temperature, humidity, pressure differential, particle count), stores time-series data, visualizes live trends, and generates alerts for GMP threshold violations with role-based login (Operator / QA / Admin).
